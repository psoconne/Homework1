Meanwhile, data scientists are mainly focused on business problems and result, bring model to data, need to work with messy and large amounts of data in various formats, work with both structured and unstructured data, and are usually embedded in production system. Both statisticians and data scientists work closely with data.\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\n\nI think that between the two I would want to be a data scientist. It seems like there would be more of a challenge to wrangle to data as a data scientist since it can be so messy and large. I also like that they are so focused on business problems."
